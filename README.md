# Unscripted-Travel-Guide

We have created a travel guide website that will enable users to get a variety of current and relevant data for countries that they plan to travel to. This will not only prove to be incredibly useful but it will also be interesting. Along side the information, we have also linked a second API that fetches current pictures of the country

* Has a dashboard with form inputs.
* Allows a user to search for a city and then see the current weather conditions for that city.
* Allows a user to view future weather conditions for that city and are presented with a 5-day forecast 
* Allows a user to click on a city in the search history and are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
