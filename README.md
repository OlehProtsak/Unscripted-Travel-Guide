# Unscripted-Travel-Guide

We have created a travel guide website that will enable users to get a variety of current and relevant data for countries that they plan to travel to. This will not only prove to be incredibly useful but it will also be interesting. Along side the information, we have also linked a second API that fetches current pictures of the country

* Has a dashboard with form inputs.
* Allows a user to search for a country and then see the current metrics for the country.
* Allows a user to view relevant images associated with the country. 
* Allows a user to click on a country in the search history and will again be presented with the information for that country.
